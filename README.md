# elm-docs-preview

*This was an experiment and won't be published for use.*

Use [ChristophP/elm-docs-preview](https://github.com/ChristophP/elm-docs-preview) for this purpose instead, which I didn't notice until after committing this.

## Usage

1. `elm make --docs=docs.json`
2. `node elm-docs-preview.js docs.json output-dir [--debug]`
